Unit Testing: Principles, Practices, and Patterns
==========================================================

# Part1-The Bigger picture

## 2 What is a unit test?

### 2.3 Contrasting the classical and London schools of unit testing

#### 2.3.1 Unit testing one class at a time

The point about better granularity relates to the discussion about what constitutes a
unit in unit testing. The London school considers a class as such a unit. Coming from
an object-oriented programming background, developers usually regard classes as the
atomic building blocks that lie at the foundation of every code base. This naturally
leads to treating classes as the atomic units to be verified in tests, too. This tendency is
understandable but misleading.
